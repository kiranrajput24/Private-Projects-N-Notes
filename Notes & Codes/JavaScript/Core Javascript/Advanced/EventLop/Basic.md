# nodejs

Node.js has a web API. It is a set of modules that allow you to create and interact with web applications. The web API includes modules for handling HTTP requests and responses, routing, and templating.

To use the web API, you need to import the relevant modules into your JavaScript code. For example, to handle HTTP requests, you would import the http module.

# core Js

Core JavaScript (also known as ES5) is the standard version of JavaScript that is included in all browsers. It does not include any modules for handling HTTP requests and responses, routing, or templating. These features are provided by third-party modules, such as the http module in Node.js.
